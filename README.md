PT Bukit Asam Tbk has 8 branches spread across the islands of Sumatra and Java, one of which is at Tarahan Port, Bandar Lampung. The process of shipping coal from the head office in Tanjung Enim to Tarahan Port uses land transportation, namely trains. PT Bukit Asam Tbk cooperates with PT KAI for transportation facilities in coal delivery. The problem that is often obtained in the shipping process is the presence of foreign materials in the carriage or on the side of the carriage. This results in penalties if it gets into the coal stock that will be exported. In an effort to minimize the consequences of plastic waste, research was conducted on detecting foreign materials in train cars.
